                <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">In 2017, the claimant was in his late 50s and intended to retire when he reached 60, in May 2019.  He had been employed by the first respondent as a Locum Consultant for a number of years when it was realised that this was in breach of the </span>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">NHS Appointment of Consultants Regulations 1996</span>
                <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> because the claimant was not on the specialist register.  At the time, an investigation was being undertaken into clinical concerns relating to the claimant and his practice was restricted; in the circumstances, the decision was taken not to raise the regulatory matter with him, although the issue was taken up with other (younger) Locum Consultants in the same position and, unlike others, the respondents proactively investigated early retirement costs for the claimant.  </span>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The investigation was completed by the end of 2017; it did not criticise the claimant’s clinical competence, and there was no longer a need to restrict the claimant’s practice.  When then raising the regulatory issue with the claimant, however, the ET found the respondents failed to provide the same support and encouragement to seek specialist registration as it had for others, in particular another younger Locum Consultant working in the same division.  The respondents explained that they had treated the claimant in the way that they had because they did not consider he would accept a lower status position and because he was close to his intended retirement; the ET found that these were age-related assumptions.  Having not been able to return to work at the same level and with the same autonomy, the claimant resigned in May 2018.  The ET concluded that the claimant had established a prima facie case of age discrimination and found that the respondents had failed to provide a cogent explanation that was in </span>
                <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">no sense whatsoever because of the claimant’s</span>
                <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> age.  It upheld the claimant’s claims of constructive unfair and wrongful dismissal and of direct age discrimination. </span>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">At the subsequent remedy hearing, the ET found that, had the claimant not suffered unlawful discrimination, he would not have sought specialist registration and would not have accepted a lower status position.  It held, however, that he would have accepted an offer that the first respondent had intended to make, and worked out his Locum Consultant contract pursuant to an extended notice period until his retirement in May 2019.  This arrangement would have been ultra vires pursuant to the </span>
                <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">1996 Regulations</span>
                <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> but the ET found that the first respondent considered that it was lawful and the parties’ employment relationship would in fact have continued.  In the circumstances, it made an award of compensation for past pecuniary losses, based on that counterfactual scenario, from May 2018 until May 2019. </span>

As for the respondents’ objection that it had been perverse for the ET to find that early retirement had not been considered for other (younger) Locum Consultants, the evidence at trial was not such that it could properly be said that the ET reached a conclusion that had not been open to it on the material adduced (or not adduced) below.  The ET had properly applied the burden of proof and, given its primary findings of fact, had been entitled to conclude that the claimant had made out a prima facie case of age discrimination such that it was for the respondents to produce cogent evidence to explain their reasons for his less favourable treatment and to demonstrate that it was in no sense whatsoever because of age.  It was, furthermore, apparent that the ET had been satisfied that the reason for the less favourable treatment of the claimant was because of age.  The ET had not treated this as a </span>

He knew from experience that the application process was time-consuming. The claimant also knew that [his named comparator] Mr Hakky had been, like him, employed as a Locum Consultant for several years.

It was Mr Vale’s evidence that he could not permit the claimant to return to his Locum Consultant duties.  As a consequence, the claimant’s restriction remained in force pending his intended return in an amended role; that, the ET found, was the reason for his continued restriction from January 2018.  In oral evidence, Mr Vale agreed, however, that this restriction should have ended sooner: it was serious, risked de-skilling, carried stigma and caused reputational damage.  The ET found this had the effect of damaging the claimant’s trust and confidence in the first respondent and noted that the same approach was not taken with Mr Hakky:</span>

The Division has previously explored the option of redundancy but this option is not viable for financial reasons. Quite separate to this, the Division has raised issues about his competence which have been largely resolved through investigation of the issues raised including two Serious Incidents. [The claimant]’s communication was criticised, but his surgical skills and judgement were not found to be below an acceptable standard. Through the Medical Director’s office we have been in on-going discussions with the BMA about a possible resolution. We have reached a point where resolution is possible without dismissal but this will involve extending his contract for a final period not to exceed 6 months + a 3 month notice period effectively an extended notice period of 9 months terminating his contract under a settlement agreement at the end of February 2019. During this time we will be able to use his services on locum consultant duties as before.

Specifically (and adopting the ET’s own summary of its conclusions, at paragraph 99 of the liability judgment): (a) Mr Hakky had been consulted in relation to the regulatory issue from September 2017, (b) he was told he would continue to be seen by his colleagues as a Consultant with the same role and responsibilities, (c) he was told that steps would be taken to mitigate the reduction to his pay, (d) he was supported in retaining the same duties before it was agreed that his Locum Consultant contract would be extended, (e) he was encouraged and supported to make an application to join the Register, (f) he was retained in the same role and on the same pay pending his specialist registration more than three years after the regulatory issue had been identified.</span>

That, it considered, was relevant to the determination of the reason for the treatment complained of by the claimant (see paragraph 197(1), liability judgment).  The respondents object that the ET thereby lost sight of the different circumstances of the two cases: specifically, the regulatory issue was identified at a point in time when the claimant’s clinical competence was under investigation and his practice was restricted.  Although the ET found that, in October 2017, Ms Eaton had advised that there was no need to delay consulting the claimant about the regulatory issue, it had also accepted the explanations given by the second respondent and Mr Vale for nevertheless deciding not to discuss this with him at that stage: given the on-going investigation and continuing restriction, unlike Mr Hakky, there was no immediate imperative for the regulatory issue to be raised with the claimant as he was not undertaking clinical duties and it was therefore unnecessary to discuss with him the need for supervision (paragraphs 87, 89 and 90, liability judgment).</span>

Although (given Ms Eaton’s advice) the ET might have considered the respondents’ position unreasonable, that was not the relevant question.  In determining whether the claimant’s circumstances (other than the difference of age) were comparable to those of Mr Hakky, it was a material point of distinction that the respondents had seen the continuing investigation and practice restriction as relevant, even if, objectively speaking, another (more reasonable) employer would not have taken the same view (see </span>

Although there were still differences between the claimant’s circumstances and those of Mr Hakky, on the ET’s findings, these were no longer material.  The issue of the (potential) disciplinary process had to be resolved, but there was no longer any clinical reason for his continued restriction from practice (paragraph 103, ET liability judgment).  Thereafter, on the ET’s findings of fact, it was not the investigation (or the potential disciplinary hearing) that impacted upon the claimant’s ability to return to work, rather it was the respondents’ response to the regulatory issue in his case (see, for example, the ET at paragraphs 114 and 127, liability judgment and note its findings on issues (n), (t) and (x)).  That, however, was the same issue that arose in respect of Mr Hakky: both were Locum Consultants who had been employed for more than 12 months without being on the Register and the respondents thus faced the same dilemma in determining how to handle this situation. </span>

Comparing like with like, however, that objection does not withstand the ET’s findings of fact.  From the respondents’ perspective, both Mr Hakky and the claimant had been employed for some time without being entered on the Register.  When the regulatory issue was first raised with Mr Hakky, however, the ET found that the questions being asked internally related to his moving on to the Register, and that he had been reassured that he would be supported in his application and that, in the meantime, he would continue to be treated “</span>

In contrast, in the autumn of 2017, the respondents proactively investigated the costs of terminating the claimant’s employment (paragraph 84, liability judgment) and, when the regulatory issue was first raised with the claimant in December 2017 and January 2018, he was not invited to make an application for specialist registration but was told he would be moved to the more junior role of Speciality Doctor, working to a revised job plan, without the same autonomy (paragraphs 109-110, liability judgment). </span>

Thus, although advised by Ms Eaton that the claimant could return to his Consultant duties until his contract expired (see, for example, paragraphs 127 and 131 liability judgment), the respondents did not communicate that to the claimant but, on the contrary, further extended his restriction.  That, as the ET found, stood in obvious contrast to the very positive steps taken to reassure Mr Hakky of the arrangements that had been put in place to enable him to continue with his Consultant duties notwithstanding the on-going regulatory issue.  Similarly, when communicating with the claimant about his return to work, the ET found there was a reluctance to engage with him or to take the necessary steps to enable him to retain his autonomy and status (see, for example, paragraphs 130, 131, 133-135, liability judgment).  Again, the ET permissibly found this was very different to the way in which the respondents had engaged with Mr Hakky. </span>

More than that, however, the ET was clear that Mr Hakky’s status and continued ability to work autonomously, and without financial detriment, had been assured by the respondents throughout (see the findings at paragraphs 87-99, liability judgment).  Similar assurances had not been given to the claimant, notwithstanding the respondents’ awareness that, from December 2017/January 2018, there was no reason why he too should not be at work, continuing to carry out his former duties (paragraphs 109-112, 114, 127-131, and 134-135 liability judgment).  As for the claimant’s appraisal, the ET found this resulted from the same lack of support.  Although there had been no continuing justification for the claimant’s restriction from practice during 2018, by 26 April 2018 this had still not been undertaken (paragraph 132, liability judgment).  The ET permissibly considered this illustrative of the respondents’ failure to preserve the claimant’s role and to provide a similar level of support to that provided to Mr Hakky.  On this point, even if Mr Hakky’s position was not precisely on all fours with that of the claimant, the ET was entitled to see his case as probative of how the respondents might otherwise have behaved. </span>

Although the respondents have identified an error on the ET’s part when considering the explanation provided for the treatment of the claimant prior to December 2017 (see the discussion at paragraph 68 above), the reason provided at that earlier stage (the on-going investigation and the justified practice restriction) no longer applied thereafter.  Once the earlier justifications for not consulting with the claimant about the regulatory issue had ceased to apply, given its findings as to the difference in the claimant’s treatment as compared to Mr Hakky, the ET was entitled to look to see what cogent evidence there was to demonstrate that this was for a reason other than age. </span>

As previously discussed, however, those reasons did not withstand scrutiny by the ET.  Thus, it did not accept that the question of early retirement was considered in other cases because there was no evidence that this was done.  Early retirement was, however, something proactively explored in the claimant’s case - even before the regulatory issue had been raised with him - because of his age and his stated intention to retire at 60, and because it was considered he would not be prepared to accept a more junior role (albeit this last consideration also applied to others).  Equally, the ET did not accept that the claimant’s continued practice restriction was a reason for the difference in treatment, because it found that the only reason for the failure to return the claimant to his duties arose from the respondents’ response to the regulatory issue in his case.  The ET did not accept that this was explained by the claimant’s reluctance to apply for specialist registration, because the respondents had never invited him to apply and had simply never approached the issue in the same (very supportive) way they had with others, such as Mr Hakky. </span>

As the claimant has observed, the specific objections raised by the grounds of appeal relate to only some of the reasons provided by the ET for its decision on the section 13 claim (see paragraph 197, liability judgment).  Properly engaging with the ET’s findings of fact, for the reasons I have explained, I cannot see that the respondents’ objections are made out.  Taken along with the other factors relied on by the ET, the decision reached was one that was permissible on the evidence and findings of fact in this case.  Properly understood, the liability appeal is an attempt to re-run the respondents’ case below and to seek to persuade this appellate tribunal to take a different view of the facts to that reached by the ET.

In other words, I believe that this solution does justice both to the facts that occurred, and to the doctrine of ultra vires and thus to the need to ignore, and not by other means to give effect to, the false formal basis upon which the parties mistakenly believed themselves to be acting.”</span>

I do not think that is even inconsistent with the parallel existence of restitutionary remedies. Thus, in this case, it is possible to say that in contract Mr Foster was entitled to claim reasonable remuneration for the work that he did, or in other words quantum meruit, whilst in restitution he was both prima facie obliged to return the sums he received under the void compromise agreement and at the same time entitled to a defence of change of position.”</span>

                                <span style="font-size:12pt;color:#3D3D3D">It is submitted that it was very unfortunate that the Court invoked the idea of a “quasi-contractual” obligation, since it is now widely accepted that “quasi-contract” is a misleading and unhelpful label. It is also regrettable that the Court regarded the quantum meruit remedy as “contractual”, since this blurred the fundamental distinction between claims for breach of contract, and claims in unjust enrichment. Furthermore, it seems to be rather artificial to regard the employee as having implicitly contracted to do work for a “reasonable remuneration” when in fact he had expressly agreed to do it for his full salary. The artificiality of the contractual analysis suggests that greater consideration should have been given to the possibility of analysing the situation purely in terms of unjust enrichment. This could have been done by regarding the services provided by the employee as having been performed on the understanding, subsequently shown to be incorrect, that a valid contractual obligation existed for remuneration. In other words, the situation could have been analysed in terms of failure of basis. This analysis has three advantages over the contractual analysis. First, it avoids the need to construct a parallel, implicit contract on different terms to the agreement actually made between the parties. Second, it is a more accurate reflection of what actually took place. Third, it has the advantage of simplicity, since it eliminates the need to investigate any potential relationship between claims in contract and for unjust enrichment.”</span>

An award of damages in this context should seek to place a claimant into the position they would have been in if the wrong had not been sustained (</span>

On the ET’s findings, however, that would not have meant that the claimant would not in fact have worked for the first respondent, carrying out the duties of a Locum Consultant, for that period.  On the contrary, his employment relationship with the first respondent would have continued and he would have carried out services “</span>

That, after all, had been the position of the claimant and a number of other Locum Consultants prior to the respondents’ appreciation of the regulatory issue in 2017, and that, as the ET found, continued to be the position in relation to Mr Hakky throughout the period in question (May 2018-May 2019) (paragraph 49, remedy judgment).  Indeed, the ET concluded, given that the arrangement had been sanctioned by the Medical Director’s Office, the view within the first respondent at the time was that this would have been lawful (again, see the citations at paragraph 41, remedy judgment). </span>

By compensating the claimant for what it had held would have occurred had he not suffered unlawful discrimination, the ET was recognising the reality of the claimant’s loss on the counterfactual basis it had found.  Its award of damages for past pecuniary losses neither condoned an unlawful contract nor offended public policy more generally.  On the contrary, had the ET declined to make an award of compensation for past pecuniary loss in these circumstances, it would have failed to put the claimant in the position that it had found he would have been in had the wrongdoing not occurred.   The respondents would thus avoid the consequences of their unlawful discrimination and the claimant would be deprived of the compensation otherwise due to him for his loss.

In the circumstances of this case, I cannot see that the denial of the award of damages for past pecuniary losses would be a proportionate response to the subsequent identification of the unlawful nature of the arrangement the ET found the parties would have entered into. </span>
