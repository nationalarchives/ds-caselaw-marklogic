              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">In 2017, the claimant was in his late 50s and intended to retire when he reached 60, in May 2019.  He had been employed by the first respondent as a Locum Consultant for a number of years when it was realised that this was in breach of the </span>
              <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">NHS Appointment of Consultants Regulations 1996</span>
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> because the claimant was not on the specialist register.  At the time, an investigation was being undertaken into clinical concerns relating to the claimant and his practice was restricted; in the circumstances, the decision was taken not to raise the regulatory matter with him, although the issue was taken up with other (younger) Locum Consultants in the same position and, unlike others, the respondents proactively investigated early retirement costs for the claimant.  </span>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The investigation was completed by the end of 2017; it did not criticise the claimant&#8217;s clinical competence, and there was no longer a need to restrict the claimant&#8217;s practice.  When then raising the regulatory issue with the claimant, however, the ET found the respondents failed to provide the same support and encouragement to seek specialist registration as it had for others, in particular another younger Locum Consultant working in the same division.  The respondents explained that they had treated the claimant in the way that they had because they did not consider he would accept a lower status position and because he was close to his intended retirement; the ET found that these were age-related assumptions.  Having not been able to return to work at the same level and with the same autonomy, the claimant resigned in May 2018.  The ET concluded that the claimant had established a prima facie case of age discrimination and found that the respondents had failed to provide a cogent explanation that was in </span>
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">no sense whatsoever because of the claimant&#8217;s</span>
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> age.  It upheld the claimant&#8217;s claims of constructive unfair and wrongful dismissal and of direct age discrimination. </span>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">At the subsequent remedy hearing, the ET found that, had the claimant not suffered unlawful discrimination, he would not have sought specialist registration and would not have accepted a lower status position.  It held, however, that he would have accepted an offer that the first respondent had intended to make, and worked out his Locum Consultant contract pursuant to an extended notice period until his retirement in May 2019.  This arrangement would have been ultra vires pursuant to the </span>
              <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">1996 Regulations</span>
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> but the ET found that the first respondent considered that it was lawful and the parties&#8217; employment relationship would in fact have continued.  In the circumstances, it made an award of compensation for past pecuniary losses, based on that counterfactual scenario, from May 2018 until May 2019. </span>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The respondents appealed both decisions. </span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">In relation to liability, although the ET had erred in failing to have regard to the respondents&#8217; reasons (accepted by the ET in its findings of fact) for their different treatment of the claimant up to December 2017, it had permissibly seen the claimant&#8217;s circumstances as materially the same as his named comparator thereafter.  As for the respondents&#8217; objection that it had been perverse for the ET to find that early retirement had not been considered for other (younger) Locum Consultants, the evidence at trial was not such that it could properly be said that the ET reached a conclusion that had not been open to it on the material adduced (or not adduced) below.  The ET had properly applied the burden of proof and, given its primary findings of fact, had been entitled to conclude that the claimant had made out a prima facie case of age discrimination such that it was for the respondents to produce cogent evidence to explain their reasons for his less favourable treatment and to demonstrate that it was in no sense whatsoever because of age.  It was, furthermore, apparent that the ET had been satisfied that the reason for the less favourable treatment of the claimant was because of age.  The ET had not treated this as a </span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> type of case but had permissibly found that the respondents had made assumptions about the claimant&#8217;s response to the regulatory issue that were related to his age. </span>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">As for the remedy appeal, the ET had found that, had he not suffered unlawful discrimination, the claimant would have continued in a lawful employment relationship with the first respondent until May 2019, providing Locum Consultant services pursuant to an agreement that would have been unlawful pursuant to the 1996 Regulations.  Given the need to put the claimant in the position he would have been in had the wrong not occurred, the award of damages for these past pecuniary losses recognised what the ET had found would have been the reality of this counterfactual situation (and see </span>

This regulatory issue in so far as it related to the claimant was not identified by the first respondent until July 2017 and the second respondent was made aware of this issue later that year.  We find that this status quo suited the claimant as he was able to do the same work with the same autonomy and pay, and broadly the same status as a substantively employed consultant. He knew from experience that the application process was time-consuming. The claimant also knew that [his named comparator] Mr Hakky had been, like him, employed as a Locum Consultant for several years.  The claimant&#8217;s oral evidence, which we accept, was that he had come to understand that specialist registration was not a prerequisite to work as a Consultant.&#8221;</span>
