But it will be an error for the tribunal, in such a case, to confine its consideration to such terms, to treat them as conclusive, or to treat them as giving rise to a presumption which restricts what it might conclude from its consideration of all the facts and circumstances in accordance with the </span>

In a reserved decision following a hearing in Cambridge before Employment Judge Ord the tribunal determined that the claimant was not an employee of the first respondent and so it dismissed his unfair dismissal claim.

The first respondent is, I am told, now in voluntary liquidation and has not participated in today’s hearing.  Nor has the second respondent, although its solicitor, Ms Heinz, attended today.  She told me that she was not seeking to be heard and her client stands neutral on this appeal.  It is fair to note that its overarching position is that there is no proper basis for it to have been made a party to the employment tribunal proceedings at all, but that is an issue that the tribunal has yet to determine.  As before the employment tribunal, the claimant has been represented today by Mr McNerney and the third and fourth respondents by Mr Butler, both of counsel, Mr Butler also having represented the first respondent before the tribunal.</span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The tribunal began its findings of fact by setting out that until 1 April 2013 the claimant, who is a dentist, was the principal of a group of three dental practices.  He sold the business comprising those practices to the first respondent with effect from that date.  Upon the first respondent’s acquisition of the business, the claimant and the first respondent entered into a contract headed “Associate Agreement for use in GDS Contracts”.  That is a form of standard contract produced by the British Dental Association (BDA).  The claimant had himself previously entered into contracts in that same form, with dentists who had done work for him prior to his sale of the business.  </span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The tribunal described or set out a large number of the provisions of that agreement in the course of its decision.  I do not need to set them out at any length.  However, I note the following.  The agreement defined the first respondent as “the practice owner” and the claimant as a “performer” who was engaged by it to provide services under the head agreement and privately.  It stated that the first respondent granted the claimant a non-exclusive licence and authority to carry on the practice of dentistry at specified premises and surgeries of the first respondent.  The agreement was stated to be personal to the parties and not capable of assignment.  It also contained provisions asserting that nothing in it constituted a partnership and nothing in it constituted a contract of employment.  </span>

There were provisions that if the claimant did not meet the target in a given year, he could be required to pay a sum calculated by reference to the amount of the licence fee per UDA, multiplied by the shortfall in UDAs, to the extent that those had not been completed by another performer at the practice.  </span>

At [23] the tribunal identified that in his particulars of claim the claimant claimed to be an employee on the basis that there was mutuality of obligation, that he was fully integrated into the practice, the first respondent exercised a significant degree of control over him and that he was required to provide personal service.  His particulars of those matters cited various provisions of the Associate Agreement in support.  As to personal service, his particulars contended that clause 36 “was not a genuine substitution clause” and was never engaged by the first respondent. </span>
