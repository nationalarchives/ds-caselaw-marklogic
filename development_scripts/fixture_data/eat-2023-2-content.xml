But it will be an error for the tribunal, in such a case, to confine its consideration to such terms, to treat them as conclusive, or to treat them as giving rise to a presumption which restricts what it might conclude from its consideration of all the facts and circumstances in accordance with the </span>

The first respondent is, I am told, now in voluntary liquidation and has not participated in today’s hearing.  Nor has the second respondent, although its solicitor, Ms Heinz, attended today.  She told me that she was not seeking to be heard and her client stands neutral on this appeal.  It is fair to note that its overarching position is that there is no proper basis for it to have been made a party to the employment tribunal proceedings at all, but that is an issue that the tribunal has yet to determine.  As before the employment tribunal, the claimant has been represented today by Mr McNerney and the third and fourth respondents by Mr Butler, both of counsel, Mr Butler also having represented the first respondent before the tribunal.</span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The tribunal began its findings of fact by setting out that until 1 April 2013 the claimant, who is a dentist, was the principal of a group of three dental practices.  He sold the business comprising those practices to the first respondent with effect from that date.  Upon the first respondent’s acquisition of the business, the claimant and the first respondent entered into a contract headed “Associate Agreement for use in GDS Contracts”.  That is a form of standard contract produced by the British Dental Association (BDA).  The claimant had himself previously entered into contracts in that same form, with dentists who had done work for him prior to his sale of the business.  </span>

I do not need to set them out at any length.  However, I note the following.  The agreement defined the first respondent as “the practice owner” and the claimant as a “performer” who was engaged by it to provide services under the head agreement and privately.  It stated that the first respondent granted the claimant a non-exclusive licence and authority to carry on the practice of dentistry at specified premises and surgeries of the first respondent.  The agreement was stated to be personal to the parties and not capable of assignment.  It also contained provisions asserting that nothing in it constituted a partnership and nothing in it constituted a contract of employment.  </span>

There were provisions that if the claimant did not meet the target in a given year, he could be required to pay a sum calculated by reference to the amount of the licence fee per UDA, multiplied by the shortfall in UDAs, to the extent that those had not been completed by another performer at the practice.  </span>

To do so would reinstate the mischief which the legislation was enacted to prevent.  It is the very fact that an employer is often in a position to dictate such contract terms and that the individual performing the work has little or no ability to influence those terms that gives rise to the need for statutory protection in the first place.  The efficacy of such protection would be seriously undermined if the putative employer could by the way in which the relationship is characterised in the written contract determine, even prima facie, whether or not the party is to be classified as a worker.  Laws such as the National Minimum Wage Act were manifestly enacted to protect those whom Parliament considers to be in need of protection and not just those who are designated by their employer as qualifying for it.</span>

The Services Agreement (like the Partner Terms before it) was drafted by Uber's lawyers and presented to drivers as containing terms which they had to accept in order to use, or continue to use, the Uber app.  It is unlikely that many drivers ever read these terms or, even if they did, understood their intended legal significance.  In any case there was no practical possibility of negotiating any different terms.  In these circumstances to treat the way in which the relationships between Uber, drivers and passengers are characterised by the terms of the Services Agreement as the starting point in classifying the parties' relationship, and as conclusive if the facts are consistent with more than one possible legal classification, would in effect be to accord Uber power to determine for itself whether or not the legislation designed to protect workers will apply to its drivers.</span>

Secondly, that approach does not hold that where there is what purports to be a written agreement, its terms should necessarily be regarded as irrelevant to that quest in every case.  Rather, where this is in issue, consideration must be given to whether there are circumstances or features of the wider picture which indicate that those written terms may not reflect the true reality of what was agreed.  In considering that question the court or tribunal is also not restricted by the conventional principles of contract law, which would ordinarily restrict its ability to consider evidence of other facts and circumstances which may be said to cast light on that.  </span>

It explains that for this reason a different approach is required to ensure that the protection which Parliament intended to confer on those who have little or no ability to influence the terms of their contract in relation to matters such as wages or paid holidays, is not defeated by their employer using the written contract terms to designate whether they qualify for those very rights.  </span>

His case was not that a consideration of the realities would show that they did not, or that for any other reason he should be taken not to have truly signified his agreement to them when he signed them.  His case was, rather, that the circumstances had changed since that agreement was signed in 2013 and by the time that the relationship ended in 2018.  The tribunal considered that contention on the evidence and made unassailable findings of fact that it was not made out.  I do not think that that submission entirely disposes of this ground.

These included: that the agreement was not produced by the respondent but was in a standard form produced by the BDA; that it had been used before by the claimant himself when he was the principal of the business in that capacity; that it was entered into on the occasion of the sale of the business by him to the first respondent; that the claimant reminded the first respondent more than once subsequently that he and his colleagues were not employees but, as he put it, independent contractors paid at a piece rate, supporting the inference that he was entirely cognisant of the contents and significance of what he had signed; and that he accepted and agreed in evidence that when the agreement was signed it was the mutual intention of the parties that he was to be engaged as a self-employed person.  The foregoing are all features which were plainly considered by the tribunal and which concerned the wider circumstances of the case looking beyond the written terms of the agreement.  It is relevant also that the tribunal noted at [62] that the claimant did not assert that the written agreement failed to reflect the position “on the ground”.  </span>

The tribunal came to a conclusion, that it was entitled to reach and cannot be challenged on appeal, that on examination nothing had changed from the start, during the course of the relationship, and up to the time that it came to an end.  </span>

At [64.2] and again at [75] the tribunal referred both to this clause and to the intention of the parties.  Given all of that, and that, as I have described, the tribunal surveyed the circumstances going beyond the terms of the written agreement, I think it is clear that it did not treat this clause as providing a determinative and complete answer to this issue by itself.  Rather, it concluded that it was a genuine reflection of what the other evidence, both of the various terms of the agreement and beyond, showed were the parties’ true intentions as to how the relationship would operate, all of which material was regarded as supporting the conclusion that this was not a contract of employment.  </span>

Here, the focus is on the tribunal’s conclusion, specifically at [97], that clause 36 of the written agreement was inconsistent with a contract of employment.  Mr Butler noted that ground 3 is narrowly drawn, asserting that the specific error was one of the tribunal failing to consider whether the phrase “other cause” should be given the meaning of not requiring any cause, or, in the alternative, requiring a cause of a nature similar to ill health.  In his skeleton argument Mr McNerney put forward a wide-ranging submission as to what he said were a number of defects in the tribunal’s consideration of whether that clause did or did not negative the requirement for an obligation of personal service, drawing and relying upon various passages in the discussion in </span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">.  Mr Butler, however, submitted that it was not open to the claimant to mount new lines of challenge not covered by ground 3, in the absence of an application to amend being made and granted.  Mr McNerney in reply accepted that he was confined to ground 3 as framed and did not apply to amend.</span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Nevertheless, part of Mr McNerney’s case, once again echoing ground 1, is that the tribunal erred by focusing on the terms of the written agreement and failing to consider the reality of whether personal service was required and promised.  In principle, a written term which appears to negative an obligation of personal service could, in a given case, be found not to reflect the wider realities and actual intentions of the parties.  However, in this case the actual ground is confined to the question of </span>
              <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">interpretation </span>
              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">of the meaning of the clause.  There is no challenge to the decision that the clause was genuine in the sense that its wording accurately reflected the parties’ intentions.  Similarly, the argument that the fact that the clause had not been invoked during the five years of the relationship should have been considered relevant by the tribunal, is not within scope of this ground of appeal.  </span>

Some of them are decisions of the EAT, which are not.  In the light of the cases and the language and objects of the relevant legislation, I would summarise as follows the applicable principles as to the requirement for personal performance.  Firstly, an unfettered right to substitute another person to do the work or perform the services is inconsistent with an undertaking to do so personally.  Secondly, a conditional right to substitute another person may or may not be inconsistent with personal performance depending upon the conditionality.  It will depend on the precise contractual arrangements and, in particular, the nature and degree of any fetter on a right of substitution or, using different language, the extent to which the right of substitution is limited or occasional.  Thirdly, by way of example, a right of substitution only when the contractor is unable to carry out the work will, subject to any exceptional facts, be consistent with personal performance.  Fourthly, again by way of example, a right of substitution limited only by the need to show that the substitute is as qualified as the contractor to do the work, whether or not that entails a particular procedure, will, subject to any exceptional facts, be inconsistent with personal performance.  Fifthly, again by way of example, a right to substitute only with the consent of another person who has an absolute and unqualified discretion to withhold consent will be consistent with personal performance.”</span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">In the present case I consider that the tribunal did err at [83] as asserted by this ground.  The example given there, that if the claimant had wished to take a holiday he would have been entitled to procure a locum to fill his absence, shows that it took the view that this clause effectively gave the claimant a free choice, if he wished, for any reason, to nominate a substitute.  That is an erroneous reading of the natural meaning of the opening words of clause 36, which describe the event that triggers the rest of the clause as being a failure through ill health or other cause to utilise the facilities for a continuous period of more than 20 days.  The obligation thereby triggered is to use best endeavours to make arrangements for the use of the facilities by a locum.  </span>

Further, “through ill health or other cause”, must be read as meaning “ill health or other similar cause.”  That is to say, the other cause contemplated will also be one that has not been chosen by the claimant, but has in some sense been visited upon him.

But Mr Butler fairly submitted that this was not a point that had been identified or raised by Mr McNerney and I do not rely upon it.  Even if clause 16 did not exist, I would consider that the tribunal erred in its construction of the phrase “other cause” in clause 36 for the reasons I have given.</span>

There is some measure of agreement.  Firstly, both counsel agree, rightly in my view, that the error that I have identified in upholding ground 3 contributed to the tribunal’s conclusion that the personal service requirement of an employment contract was not satisfied in this case; and therefore that conclusion cannot stand and that matter must be remitted to the tribunal for fresh consideration.  Counsel also agree that it is at least possible that if the tribunal reaches a different conclusion next time on the question of whether the agreement satisfied the requirement for personal service, that could impact on its overall conclusion as to whether the claimant was an employee, even if all the other findings in EJ Ord’s decision remain as given.  Neither of them suggested that I could dispose of the matter on the basis that there can only be one right answer to those questions.</span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">What they disagree about is the following.  Firstly, Mr Butler says that the tribunal's consideration next time around should be confined solely to the question of construction of the reference in clause 36 to “ill health or other cause” and, depending on that, whether clause 36 negates an obligation of personal service.  However, as I have said, those words have to be considered in the context of the whole clause; and so, upon remission, in order to reach a fair and just outcome, the tribunal needs to look afresh at the implications of that clause as a whole.  But I agree with Mr Butler that on the question of personal service the tribunal does not need to look </span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> the implications of that clause, because the respondents’ case on the personal service point rests solely upon it.  I also agree with him that the tribunal will not be concerned with an </span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">While it is common ground that if the tribunal concludes that clause 36 does not negate personal service, that could in turn have an impact on its conclusion on the overall question of whether the claimant was an employee, Mr McNerney, putting his case at its highest, argued that all of those questions should be amenable to entirely fresh consideration.  However, his fallback position was, in agreement with Mr Butler, that EJ Ord’s findings on all other matters could be taken as a starting point, save in relation to clause 36, so that if the second time around it was found that the personal service requirement was not negated by that clause, the tribunal will then need to feed that finding in to the picture created by the overall findings already made by EJ Ord, which should therefore stand.</span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">I consider that is the appropriate basis on which remit.  I have rejected grounds 1 and 2 and I can see nothing wrong with EJ Ord’s approach which led to his findings of fact and conclusions on the other matters that feed into a consideration of whether the claimant was an employee.  As Mr Butler accepts, that does not mean that a conclusion that there was an obligation of personal service could not affect the overall outcome.  But there is no need to require all of EJ Ord’s other findings to be cast aside.</span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Lastly, counsel disagree as to whether I should allow that EJ Ord may preside when this matter is further considered.  I was told that the claimant at any rate may well be asking for a hearing before a judge and members next to be convened, to decide all outstanding issues at one final trial, including the issue of worker or employee status and the substance of the claim that the termination of the relationship was unlawful.  But that does not as such affect my decision on this particular aspect.  </span>

              <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">I am persuaded by Mr McNerney that I should direct that EJ Ord should not decide this issue. Whilst I have upheld this appeal only on one point and directed that on all other points EJ Ord’s findings should serve as the starting point next time, nevertheless this point does have potentially very significant implications for this litigation.  Although the claimant claims to have been a worker, if not an employee, which has yet to be considered, personal service is a requirement for worker status as well.  So the decision on this point could potentially be determinative of the entire claim.</span>

It will be important, whatever the outcome next time, that the decision commands the confidence of both parties.  No doubt there is a strong desire for finality in this litigation, which has already been running for some four years and looks set to go into possibly a fifth year.  </span>
