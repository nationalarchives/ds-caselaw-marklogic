	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The respondent appealed against the liability judgment of the tribunal upholding the claimant’s claim </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">of failure to make reasonable adjustments for his disability (dyspraxia) in connection with his application for a job with the respondent under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/20" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15 s. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 20</ref>, 21 and 39(5) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27" uk:canonical="2010 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">EA 2010</ref>) by allowing him to make an oral application by telephone. The tribunal had in reaching its judgment rejected the respondent’s arguments: (a) the claimant was not under a ‘substantial disadvantage’ because he was not a genuine applicant for employment as he had (among other things), only a short time earlier been dismissed from a similar role in the same team under the same line manager who was responsible for hiring for the new role; and (b) that the respondent had not come under a duty to make reasonable adjustments because the claimant had not explained, despite being asked by email on a number of occasions, what his specific difficulties were with completing the online application.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">Held:-</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">The Tribunal had reached a material perverse finding of fact in the course of deciding that the claimant was a genuine applicant as it had wrongly thought that the new role was in a ‘different team’ to the one the claimant had worked in previously. Otherwise, there were no errors of law in the Tribunal’s conclusion that the respondent ought to have had the requisite knowledge of the claimant’s disadvantage because it ought to have telephoned the claimant to ask for more details of his difficulties when the claimant had failed to respond to the respondent’s email questions. The case was remitted to the same Tribunal to reconsider in the light of the EAT’s judgment.</span></p>

By that judgment, the Tribunal upheld the claimant’s claim of failure to make reasonable adjustments for his disability (dyspraxia) in connection with his application for a job with the respondent under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/20" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15 s. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 20</ref>, 21 and 39(5) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27" uk:canonical="2010 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">EA 2010</ref>). The Tribunal went on at a remedy hearing on 18 November 2022 (judgment sent to the parties on 3 January 2023, following a day of deliberation) to award the claimant £2,000 by way of injury to feelings, together with interest of £700.</span></p>

The claimant appealed his dismissal and also brought a disability discrimination claim to the Tribunal about that dismissal, which claim was settled without admission of liability. In the course of settling that previous claim, the claimant sought a specific assurance from the respondent that there would be no restriction on him applying for other roles in future – an assurance which was given by the respondent.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">Mrs Parker, the respondent’s senior HR manager, replied to the claimant explaining that the application process required him to complete the online application form, but that if he had concerns about filling out the form, he should let them know. Mrs Parker during this correspondence asked the claimant on a number of occasions to inform her which parts of the form he was finding it difficult to complete and explained the claimant may receive assistance in submitting the form if necessary. The correspondence between Mrs Parker and the claimant is detailed in the judgement of the tribunal below and we do not need to set it all out here. Suffice it to say, that the claimant continued to state that he was happy to do the online form over the phone and would prefer to make an oral application, while Mrs Parker repeated that he needed to complete the online form, but that he should let them know if he was struggling with any aspect of the form. The claimant never answered Mrs Parker’s question about what aspect of the form he was struggling with. He never told her that he could not even create a username and password and log on to the online form. Although Mrs Parker and the claimant had (or could have obtained) each other’s telephone numbers, Mrs Parker did not call the claimant and the claimant did not call Mrs Parker. The claimant’s reason for not doing so was fear of being laughed at in light of a previous experience with another employer. Mrs Parker for her part accepted in oral evidence (as the Tribunal records at paragraph 30 of its judgment) that it would have been a sensible step to call the claimant, and that she was influenced in not doing this because of his previous unsuccessful employment with the respondent and the fact that it was not her direct responsibility to be involved in the recruitment process.</span></p>

The Tribunal found (at paragraph 42) that the claimant in the course of the correspondence chose not to answer the respondent’s question about which elements of the form he was finding it hard to complete, but instead responded by asserting that ‘as the respondent knew’, he had problems filling in their forms and asking for an oral application as a reasonable adjustment.</span></p>

In reaching that conclusion, the Tribunal took into account that the claimant had performed a similar role for the respondent in the past, which he had enjoyed and (at paragraph 65(5)) that he </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">“was applying to work in a different office, the London office, and therefore in a different team from where he had worked previously when employed by the respondent, namely the Birmingham office.

The Tribunal also took into account (at paragraph 65(6)) that, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">“although other applicants might have chosen not to apply to the same employer where they had previously failed their probationary period, our assessment of the claimant’s character is that he would not have regarded this as an inevitable impediment to succeeding with this application”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">.</span></p>

It answered that question at paragraph 69, finding that the respondent (actually) </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">“knew that as a result of his dyspraxia, he had difficulty in filling in the online application form”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">, but did not know more than that because the claimant, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">“had not identified the specific reasons why completing an online application form was a particular difficulty”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">.</span></p>

Those comments were understood by the respondent to be an explanation for the sunglasses. In the event, Ms Ridout never used the sunglasses or told the employer that she was unwell or felt disadvantaged. Her complaint of failure to make reasonable adjustments was dismissed on the basis that the respondent could not reasonably be expected to know about the requirements of epileptics for particular lighting arrangements, and it was not reasonable for the employers to make any further enquiry on receipt of her application form or in the light of her comments on entering the room. Ms Ridout appealed, and the EAT dismissed her appeal. At [24]-[27] the EAT (Morison P, sitting with Mr J R Crosby and Lord Davies of Coity CBE) held:</span></p>

That is a judgment which has to be made by the fact finding tribunal. We accept what Counsel for the appellant was saying, that Industrial Tribunals should be careful not to impose on disabled people who are seeking employment a duty to "harp on" about their disability so as; so to speak, to excuse themselves at the interview process before the selection is made. One of the purposes of the legislation is to ensure that disabled people have the same opportunities for employment, and in their employment, as others not suffering from such disability. It would be unsatisfactory to expect a disabled person to have to go into a great long detailed explanation as to the effects that their disablement had on them merely to cause the employer to make adjustments which he probably should have made in the first place.</span></p>

It is equally undesirable that an employer should be required to ask a number of questions about a person suffering from a disability as to whether he or she feels disadvantaged. There may well be circumstances in which that question would not arise. It would be wrong if, merely to protect themselves from liability, the employers or prospective employers were to ask a number of questions which they would not have asked of somebody who was able-bodied. People must be taken very much on the basis of how they present themselves.</span></p>

If, on the other, she was saying that the room was causing her a problem and she might have to put on dark glasses, but that she felt disadvantaged as a result of being in that room, that would be another. This was therefore a matter of fact and evidence for the Industrial Tribunal and a judgment for them to make on the basis of the evidence as to precisely what occurred.</span></p>

The tribunal found that the employer had applied a PCP of requiring employees to get permission before leaving the workplace or be disciplined and that the employer had failed to make reasonable adjustments to help the employee cope with stress and avoid being given a disciplinary penalty. On appeal, the EAT held that the tribunal had wrongly concluded that the employer knew or ought to have known that difficulty in asking for permission was a feature of the claimant’s disability and allowed the appeal and dismissed the claim. The EAT (Lady Smith, sitting with Ms K Bilgan and Mr S Yeboah) cited <span style="font-style:italic">Ridout </span>with approval, and emphasised at [17]-[18] the importance of considering both the questions of what the employer actually knew and what they reasonably ought to have known. At [21], the EAT held as follows, making clear the importance of the employer being aware (actually or constructively) of the particular disadvantage, not just of the disability generally:-</p>

Putting matters at their highest, the employer ought to have known that there could be times when, because of his disability, the claimant might have difficulty in concentrating, difficulty in controlling his temper and severe headaches, none of those features amount to or imply difficulty in asking for permission when it was required.

The Court of Appeal (Underhill LJ) emphasised that the assessment of what the employer knew or ought to know is one of fact for the employment tribunal, with which the appellate courts should be slow to interfere:</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#3D3D3D">36.  I stand back from all of this and revert to the point which I made earlier. It is not for this Court to decide whether it might have found that the Respondent could reasonably have been expected to know in September or October 2009 that the Appellant was suffering from a disability. The question is whether it was open to the ET, on the evidence that it heard, to find that it could not. It will be apparent from what I have said already that the Respondent was presented with a good deal of not very clear information, and getting a good understanding of it was not helped by the Appellant's rather uncooperative and confrontational stance. The EAT also endorsed a submission made by Mr Brown that not all of the Appellant's absences reflected her being truly unable to work: there was an element of unwillingness too, mixed in with her substantive complaints about pay and working conditions. As it observed, the ET had to disentangle what the Appellant could not do from what she would not do. This is not an easy exercise: employers are not doctors, or psychologists.</span></p>

This Court should be very slow, absent any explicit misdirection, to depart from the considered assessment of an experienced employment judge and two lay members, endorsed by the President of the EAT and two lay members. Even if – which I am not saying is the case – I would have reached a different conclusion from the ET I am quite sure that it was entitled to reach the decision which it did.</span></p>

In that case, the first-tier tribunal had concluded that BT had failed to comply with its duty to make reasonable adjustments in relation to a job application assessment when it failed to make any enquiries as to a claimant’s declared disabilities of Asperger’s Syndrome and dyslexia. The claimant relies on the case principally because of the reference to the need for ‘proactivity’ by an employer in the Court of Appeal’s summary of the tribunal’s judgment at [16]. We appreciate why the claimant refers to this case as it is favourable on its facts to his, but we do not consider it adds anything to the legal principles that we have to apply. There is no separate duty of ‘proactivity’ beyond the legal principles we have already identified. As the Code of Practice makes clear (especially at paragraphs 16.39 and 16.49), in the context of employment (in contrast to some other areas of life covered by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27" uk:canonical="2010 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">EA 2010</ref>), the duty to make reasonable adjustments only arises once there is a specific disabled person who to the employer’s knowledge requires an adjustment - <span style="font-style:italic">“an employer is not required to make changes in anticipation of applications from disabled people in general – although it would be good practice to do so”.</span></p>

This is because the judgment does not anywhere identify the team that the claimant was in for the 2017 role, or identify the line manager for the 2017 role or the hiring manager for the 2018 role (which would have been an alternative ‘clue’ to the fact that the two roles were in the same team). While it may be the case that the claimant (who only had the information about the role that was in the advertisement) perceived the advertised role in the London office as being a ‘fresh start’, that was not the point that the Tribunal was making in paragraph 65(5). Rather, paragraph 65(5) is a finding that the 2018 role would have been not only in a different office geographically, but also in a different team so that it was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">“potentially a fresh start”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">. In fact, the undisputed evidence before the Tribunal was that the 2018 role was in the same team, with the hiring manager the same as his previous line manager.

In contrast, at the liability stage although the point was there in Mrs Parker’s witness statement, it was not so obvious and we infer that the Tribunal overlooked it when deliberating on the issue of liability – perhaps because there was a delay of about three months between the Tribunal hearing the parties’ evidence and submissions and meeting to deliberate.</span></p>

Secondly, we are not satisfied that the Tribunal would have gone on in paragraph 65(6) to conclude that the claimant would not have regarded what happened with the 2017 role as an inevitable impediment to succeeding with his application if it had appreciated that this was not (contrary to what the Tribunal said in that paragraph) a case of the claimant returning to work for the same (large) employer where he had previously failed a probationary period, but seeking to return to a similar job in the same team for which applications would be judged by the line manager who dismissed him from a similar role for poor performance eight months’ previously. That is much more unlikely and we are not satisfied that the Tribunal would have come to the same conclusion that it did on the question of whether the claimant was a genuine applicant if it had had those facts firmly in mind – although it might have done.</span></p>

Ms Barsam submits that it is obvious that the Claimant was in this email referring to talking about his job experience rather than his difficulties with the application process. We have some sympathy for Ms Barsam’s submission in this regard, but we do not consider the Tribunal’s observation was perverse: it was only saying that this was ‘one view’ of what the claimant was saying, and we agree it was one view. In any event, nothing turns on this point, because the Tribunal does not go on to say (and we do not read it as finding) that the respondent ought to have understood from that very first request that the Claimant was volunteering to explain his specific difficulties with the application process by phone. The Tribunal’s judgment is based on the whole course of the correspondence.</span></p>

Perversity is a high threshold and the Tribunal’s conclusion on this issue is well within the range of judgments open to them on this issue. The Tribunal would at this point have had in mind the totality of the evidence, which was to the effect that the respondent had repeatedly asked the claimant to explain his difficulties by email and not received an answer to that. There could really only be two explanations for the claimant’s failure to answer: </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">either</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302"> he was being deliberately obstructive in order to ‘engineer’ a disability discrimination claim because he was not a genuine applicant </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">or</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302"> he was having difficulty with written communication. The Tribunal had already rejected the former explanation (albeit we have now found it made a separate error of law in reaching that conclusion). For the purposes of this ground 4, however, given the finding that the claimant was a genuine applicant, then the only explanation for his failure to respond to the respondent’s question was that he was having difficulties with written communication.  It was well within the range of judgments open to the Tribunal to conclude on the evidence that an employer acting reasonably, when faced with an individual with a dyspraxia diagnosis asking for an adjustment to avoid filling in an online form, but failing to respond in writing to a reasonable question, would have picked up the phone to speak to that individual in order to understand their situation. </span></p>

This is not a case where we could substitute our own judgment for that of the Tribunal. The point on which the appeal has succeeded requires further consideration of the evidence and a fresh assessment. The question is whether it should be remitted to the same Tribunal or a different Tribunal. Ms Barsam urges us to remit to a different Tribunal, but we do not agree. Having regard to the guidance in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Sinclair Roche &amp; Temperley v Heard </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">[2004] IRLR 763, we consider that it is appropriate to remit the matter to the same Tribunal for the following reasons:</span></p>

That in principle may include the evidence that it received at the appeal stage as there is no reason for it to turn a ‘blind eye’ to that now that it has it, even though it did not have the benefit of that evidence at the liability stage on the first occasion, albeit that in considering whether or the claimant was a genuine applicant the focus must remain on what the claimant knew about the advertised role, not the what the respondent’s position was.</span></p>
