`brew install temurin` to get a working Java (I had to install-uninstall-install)

Download corb2 from https://github.com/marklogic-community/corb2/releases
Download xcc from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/marklogic/marklogic-xcc/11.1.0/ or https://developer.marklogic.com/products/xcc-2/ (I used maven)
(both into this directory)

`./corb migrate-ncn` will run the code, `migrate-ncn.log` will show what it writes to the identifiers
